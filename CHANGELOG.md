# ElasticRelay Changelog

## [v1.4.6] - 2026-05-12

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. MySQL DECIMAL Type Causes Elasticsearch Field Mapping Conflict (`internal/connectors/mysql/mysql.go`, `internal/parallel/worker.go`)

**Fixed MySQL DECIMAL columns triggering `mapper [field] cannot be changed from type [long] to [float]` errors in Elasticsearch:**

- **Issue**: Syncing tables with `DECIMAL` columns (e.g. `balance DECIMAL(12,2)`) failed with `illegal_argument_exception: mapper [balance] cannot be changed from type [long] to [float]`
- **Root Cause**: The Go MySQL driver returns `DECIMAL` values as `[]byte`. The existing code parsed them with `strconv.ParseFloat`, producing `float64` values. Go's `json.Marshal` drops trailing zeros from whole-number floats — e.g. `float64(3200)` serializes as JSON `3200` (no decimal point), while `float64(1500.5)` serializes as `1500.5`. Elasticsearch's dynamic mapping inferred `long` for the first document with a whole-number balance, then rejected subsequent documents with fractional values as a type conflict
- **Fix**: Changed all three `[]byte` → numeric conversion paths to use `json.Number(s)` instead of `float64` when `ParseFloat` succeeds. `json.Number` preserves the original string representation, so `"3200.00"` stays `3200.00` in JSON and `"0.00"` stays `0.00`, ensuring Elasticsearch consistently maps the field as `float`
- **Impact**: All MySQL `DECIMAL` fields now retain their decimal representation in JSON output, preventing Elasticsearch dynamic mapping type conflicts between whole-number and fractional values
- **Files Changed**:
  - `internal/connectors/mysql/mysql.go` — CDC binlog handler and snapshot handler (2 locations)
  - `internal/parallel/worker.go` — parallel snapshot worker `convertValue()` function

```go
// Before: whole-number DECIMALs lost decimal point in JSON
} else if f, err := strconv.ParseFloat(s, 64); err == nil {
    dataMap[colName] = f  // float64(3200) → JSON "3200" → ES infers long

// After: original decimal representation preserved
} else if _, err := strconv.ParseFloat(s, 64); err == nil {
    dataMap[colName] = json.Number(s)  // "3200.00" → JSON "3200.00" → ES infers float
```

#### 2. JSON Unmarshal/Marshal Round-Trips Strip Decimal Points (`internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`, `internal/transform/engine.go`, `internal/sink/es/es.go`)

**Fixed multiple JSON round-trip points that silently converted `3200.00` → `float64(3200)` → `3200`, undoing the MySQL connector's decimal preservation:**

- **Issue**: Even after the MySQL connector correctly output `json.Number("3200.00")`, three downstream JSON round-trips each used `json.Unmarshal` (which converts JSON numbers to `float64` by default), then `json.Marshal` (which drops `.00` from whole-number floats)
- **Root Cause**: Standard `json.Unmarshal` into `map[string]interface{}` always converts JSON numbers to `float64`, losing the original string representation
- **Fix**: Replaced `json.Unmarshal` with `json.NewDecoder` + `UseNumber()` at all three data-path round-trip points:
  1. `multi_orchestrator.go` `processSnapshotChunk()` — enriches snapshot records with `_table` and `_source_id`
  2. `multi_orchestrator.go` `enrichEventWithSourceID()` — adds `_source_id` to CDC events
  3. `engine.go` `Transform()` — parses event data before applying transformation rules
  4. `es.go` `cleanDataForES()` — removes metadata fields before indexing to ES
- **Impact**: Numeric values now pass through the entire pipeline without losing their decimal representation

#### 3. Transform Engine Computed Float Fields Cause Same ES Mapping Conflict (`internal/transform/expression/engine.go`, `internal/transform/type_converter.go`, `internal/transform/filter/filter.go`)

**Fixed Transform engine's math functions and type converter producing bare `float64` values that trigger the same `long` vs `float` mapping conflict in Elasticsearch:**

- **Issue**: Computed fields like `display_balance` using `round($.balance, 2)` triggered `mapper [display_balance] cannot be changed from type [float] to [long]` because `round(3200.00, 2)` returned `float64(3200)` → JSON `3200` (no decimal), while `round(1500.50, 2)` → JSON `1500.5`
- **Root Cause**: All expression engine math functions (`round`, `abs`, `floor`, `ceil`, `min`, `max`) and arithmetic operators returned bare `float64` values, which lose their decimal point for whole numbers during JSON serialization
- **Fix**:
  1. **Expression engine math functions**: `funcRound` now returns `json.Number` formatted with the specified precision (e.g. `round(3200.00, 2)` → `json.Number("3200.00")`). Other math functions (`abs`, `floor`, `ceil`, `min`, `max`) and arithmetic operators use a `floatToJSONNumber()` helper that always appends `.0` for whole numbers
  2. **Type converter**: `toFloat64` now returns `json.Number` instead of bare `float64`, ensuring fields with `target_type: "float64"` are also safe
  3. **json.Number input handling**: Added `json.Number` case to `toFloat64`, `toInt`, `toInt64`, `toBool` in all three packages (expression engine, type converter, filter engine) since MySQL connector now outputs `json.Number` values for DECIMAL columns
- **Impact**: All float-producing paths in the Transform engine now output JSON-safe representations that ES consistently maps as `float`
- **Files Changed**:
  - `internal/transform/expression/engine.go` — math functions, arithmetic, `toFloat64` helper
  - `internal/transform/type_converter.go` — `toFloat64`, `toInt`, `toInt64`, `toBool` converters
  - `internal/transform/filter/filter.go` — `toFloat64`, `toInt` comparison helpers

### ⚠️ Migration Notes

If you previously hit this error, the existing Elasticsearch index has a corrupted mapping. You must delete the affected index before restarting:

```bash
curl -u <user>:<password> -X DELETE "http://<es-host>:<port>/elasticrelay_mysql-<table>"
```

The next run will recreate the index with correct dynamic mappings.

### ✅ Verification

After this fix:

- MySQL `DECIMAL` fields like `balance DECIMAL(12,2)` with values `0.00`, `100.00`, `1500.50` all serialize with decimal points in JSON
- Computed fields like `display_balance = round($.balance, 2)` produce `3200.00`, `1500.50` consistently in JSON
- Type-converted fields with `target_type: "float64"` always include a decimal point
- Elasticsearch consistently maps these fields as `float`, eliminating the `long` vs `float` type conflict
- Filter comparisons and expression evaluations correctly handle `json.Number` input values
- Existing non-float field behavior (integers, strings, datetimes, booleans) remains unchanged

## [v1.4.5] - 2026-04-24

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. Hardcoded Elasticsearch Connection in Parallel Snapshot Manager (`internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`)

**Fixed parallel snapshot manager using hardcoded ES connection instead of sink configuration:**

- **Issue**: The `initParallelManager()` method created an ES client with hardcoded URL (`http://172.168.0.100:19200`), username (`elastic`), and password (`zIUPPogxwxCR`), ignoring the actual sink configuration
- **Root Cause**: `MultiJob` only stored `sink.Options` (a `map[string]interface{}`) but not the full `SinkConfig` struct, so connection details (`Addresses`, `User`, `Password`) were unavailable when initializing the parallel manager
- **Fix**:
  1. Added `fullSinkConfig *config.SinkConfig` field to `MultiJob` struct
  2. Updated `CreateJob()` to store the complete `SinkConfig` reference alongside the existing `Options` map
  3. Replaced hardcoded ES client parameters in `initParallelManager()` with values from `fullSinkConfig.Addresses[0]`, `fullSinkConfig.User`, and `fullSinkConfig.Password`
  4. Added validation to return a clear error when sink configuration is missing or has no addresses
- **Impact**: Parallel snapshot manager now correctly uses the ES connection configured in `sinks[].addresses`, `sinks[].user`, and `sinks[].password` from the multi-config file, eliminating the need to modify source code for different environments
- **Security**: Removed hardcoded credentials from source code

### ✅ Verification

After this fix:

- Parallel snapshot manager reads ES connection details from sink configuration instead of hardcoded values
- Missing or incomplete sink configuration produces a descriptive error rather than silently using wrong credentials
- Existing non-parallel sync behavior remains unchanged

Validation performed:

- `go vet ./internal/orchestrator/` — passed with no errors

## [v1.4.4] - 2026-03-11

### 🔧 PostgreSQL Snapshot-to-CDC and CDC Stability Fixes

This release fixes three classes of PostgreSQL synchronization issues: one during the snapshot-to-CDC handoff, where rows created in the transition window could be missed; one during sustained CDC catch-up, where downstream batch processing could stall WAL consumption and stop replication progress; and one where snapshot and CDC used different replication slots, causing part of the incremental WAL window to become unreadable.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. PostgreSQL CDC Start Checkpoint Reuse (`internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`)

**Fixed PostgreSQL CDC starting from `nil` checkpoint after snapshot:**

- **Issue**: After initial snapshot completed, PostgreSQL CDC always started with `nil` checkpoint
- **Root Cause**: The shared multi-source orchestrator did not reuse the PostgreSQL snapshot checkpoint when switching from snapshot mode to CDC mode
- **Fix**: Reused `lastCp` only for PostgreSQL jobs and passed it into `connector.Start(...)`
- **Impact**: PostgreSQL CDC now resumes from the snapshot LSN instead of jumping to the current WAL position

#### 2. PostgreSQL Snapshot Checkpoint Field Mapping (`internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`)

**Fixed PostgreSQL snapshot events being written into MySQL checkpoint fields:**

- **Issue**: Snapshot events from PostgreSQL stored their marker in `MysqlBinlogFile` and `MysqlBinlogPos`
- **Root Cause**: `processSnapshotChunk()` used a MySQL-oriented checkpoint structure for all snapshot sources
- **Fix**: Added connector-type specific checkpoint mapping so PostgreSQL snapshot events populate `Position` and `PostgresLsn`
- **Impact**: PostgreSQL checkpoint persistence and recovery now use the correct LSN fields, and logs no longer show misleading values such as `:0`

#### 3. Snapshot Chunk Consistency LSN Propagation (`internal/connectors/postgresql/parallel_integration.go`)

**Fixed snapshot chunks using moving WAL positions instead of one consistency point:**

- **Issue**: Each PostgreSQL snapshot chunk fetched `pg_current_wal_lsn()` at send time, so the chunk marker could drift during a long-running snapshot
- **Root Cause**: The adapter calculated a snapshot consistency point once, but did not propagate it through chunk processing
- **Fix**: Captured one `consistencyLSN` for the snapshot and attached the same value to every emitted chunk
- **Impact**: Snapshot completion and CDC startup now share one stable PostgreSQL handoff point

#### 4. PostgreSQL CDC Async Batch Decoupling (`internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`)

**Fixed the replication reader being blocked by downstream batch processing:**

- **Issue**: After PostgreSQL CDC events entered the orchestrator, they could synchronously trigger `transform -> sink -> checkpoint`, so slow Elasticsearch or Transform processing would also block WAL consumption
- **Root Cause**: `jobCDCStream.Send()` fed directly into the batch processing path, coupling logical replication reads with downstream writes in one execution chain
- **Fix**: Added an asynchronous `cdcEvents` queue and a dedicated batch worker for `MultiJob`, so the replication path now only enqueues events and returns quickly
- **Impact**: Long-running high-volume incremental syncs are much less likely to stall because of sink-side latency

#### 5. PostgreSQL CDC Event LSN Propagation (`internal/connectors/postgresql/wal_parser.go`)

**Fixed CDC events being emitted without the real WAL checkpoint position:**

- **Issue**: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE events could be emitted with an empty `Checkpoint.PostgresLsn`, leaving incremental checkpoints without a reliable resume position
- **Root Cause**: The WAL parser read `walStart/walEnd` from `XLogData`, but did not propagate that LSN into the emitted `ChangeEvent` checkpoint
- **Fix**: Tracked the current WAL LSN while parsing `XLogData`, then wrote it into both `Position` and `PostgresLsn` on CDC events
- **Impact**: PostgreSQL CDC checkpoints now carry the real WAL position, making resume, catch-up, and troubleshooting more reliable

#### 6. PostgreSQL Job-Scoped Replication Slot Reuse (`internal/connectors/postgresql/postgresql.go`)

**Fixed snapshot and CDC running against different replication slots:**

- **Issue**: The PostgreSQL connector previously generated slot names from timestamps, so snapshot and CDC phases often ran against different replication slots
- **Root Cause**: Slot lifecycle was tied to connector startup rather than job identity, so CDC startup could create a fresh temporary slot unrelated to the snapshot handoff context
- **Fix**: Changed PostgreSQL slot naming to a stable `jobId`-scoped slot and reused that same slot during CDC startup
- **Impact**: Each synchronization job now stays on one replication slot across snapshot and CDC, making handoff behavior much more predictable

#### 7. Replication Slot Pre-Creation Before Snapshot (`internal/connectors/postgresql/postgresql.go`, `internal/connectors/postgresql/parallel_integration.go`)

**Fixed CDC appearing to catch up early after only part of the incremental data was synced:**

- **Issue**: Even with a seemingly valid checkpoint, CDC could stop after syncing only part of the incremental workload and then continue sending keepalives without new changes
- **Root Cause**: The replication slot used to be created only when CDC started, so that slot could only see WAL retained after its own creation, not the full window between snapshot completion and CDC handoff
- **Fix**: Pre-created the publication and the job-scoped slot during `BeginSnapshot`, then made the snapshot adapter reuse that slot-aligned LSN and kept CDC on the same slot afterward
- **Impact**: Snapshot and CDC now share the same slot context, significantly reducing cases where only a subset of incremental WAL can be consumed

#### 8. PostgreSQL Logical Message Reassembly and Full Payload Parsing (`internal/connectors/postgresql/wal_parser.go`)

**Fixed CDC dropping rows when `pgoutput` messages arrived fragmented or packed together:**

- **Issue**: After large PostgreSQL inserts, Elasticsearch often received only part of the rows, and CDC could stop around a few thousand records
- **Root Cause**: The WAL parser did not reliably handle fragmented logical replication messages or multiple logical messages delivered in one WAL payload
- **Fix**: Added buffered logical message reassembly, processed all messages in a payload instead of only the first one, and hardened incomplete-message handling
- **Impact**: PostgreSQL CDC can now consume sustained high-volume insert streams much more reliably without silently losing part of the batch

#### 9. PostgreSQL CDC Primary Key Extraction Fix (`internal/connectors/postgresql/postgresql.go`, `internal/connectors/postgresql/wal_parser.go`)

**Fixed CDC events using wrong or unstable primary keys:**

- **Issue**: Some PostgreSQL CDC events generated duplicate or malformed document IDs such as repeated low values or byte-style strings, causing Elasticsearch documents to overwrite each other
- **Root Cause**: CDC primary key extraction relied on fragile assumptions about the first column and did not consistently use the table's real primary key metadata
- **Fix**: Loaded actual PostgreSQL primary key columns from schema metadata, extracted primary keys by column name, and normalized byte-backed values before building document IDs
- **Impact**: PostgreSQL CDC now produces stable Elasticsearch `_id` values, preventing row loss caused by accidental overwrites

#### 10. PostgreSQL Replication Connection Concurrency Fix (`internal/connectors/postgresql/wal_parser.go`)

**Fixed protocol desynchronization during CDC streaming:**

- **Issue**: PostgreSQL CDC intermittently failed with parse errors such as `unsupported logical replication message` or `unknown copy data message type`, and synchronization repeatedly stalled at partial counts
- **Root Cause**: The replication connection was used concurrently for message reads and keepalive writes, which is unsafe for the underlying PostgreSQL connection implementation
- **Fix**: Refactored the WAL processing loop into a single-threaded receive/send model and updated timeout handling to treat expected polling timeouts correctly
- **Impact**: PostgreSQL CDC now maintains protocol alignment under load, eliminating the recurring partial-sync failures caused by stream corruption

#### 11. PostgreSQL Force-Initial-Sync Cleanup and CDC Restart Safety (`internal/connectors/postgresql/postgresql.go`, `internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`)

**Improved recovery from failed or dirty PostgreSQL CDC runs:**

- **Issue**: After deleting checkpoints, rebuilding tables, or restarting from a failed state, PostgreSQL jobs could still resume from stale slot state or replay buffered in-memory CDC events
- **Root Cause**: Inactive replication slots were not automatically reset for forced re-sync, and the orchestrator could retain pending CDC batches across restart attempts
- **Fix**: Added automatic cleanup of inactive PostgreSQL replication slots for `force_initial_sync` and cleared in-memory CDC batch/queue state before restarting the CDC loop
- **Impact**: Re-runs after failures or environment resets are now more predictable and less likely to replay stale state

#### 12. Empty PostgreSQL Table Snapshot Guard (`internal/connectors/postgresql/parallel_integration.go`)

**Fixed parallel snapshot initialization for empty tables:**

- **Issue**: PostgreSQL parallel snapshot setup could error when a selected table currently had zero rows
- **Fix**: Skipped chunk creation for tables whose estimated row count is zero
- **Impact**: Empty tables no longer break the PostgreSQL snapshot phase

#### 13. Checkpoint Commit Noise Reduction (`internal/connectors/postgresql/postgresql.go`, `internal/connectors/postgresql/lsn_manager.go`, `internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`)

**Reduced unnecessary checkpoint overhead after the CDC stability fixes:**

- **Issue**: Once PostgreSQL CDC became stable, checkpoint commits generated excessive log noise and redundant persistence work during high-throughput batches
- **Root Cause**: Every batch flush could trigger a checkpoint gRPC call, successful commits were logged repeatedly, and the PostgreSQL checkpoint service created an unused database pool even though checkpoint persistence only writes to the local file
- **Fix**: Removed the unused checkpoint DB pool creation, suppressed repetitive success logs, skipped commits when the position had not changed, and throttled checkpoint persistence to at most once per commit interval
- **Impact**: PostgreSQL checkpoint progression remains intact while runtime logs and checkpoint overhead are significantly reduced

### ✅ Verification

After this fix:

- PostgreSQL jobs keep their existing MySQL and MongoDB behavior unchanged
- Snapshot records and CDC startup use the same PostgreSQL LSN handoff point
- PostgreSQL checkpoint logs show a real LSN instead of MySQL-style placeholder output
- PostgreSQL WAL reads and downstream batch writes are now decoupled, improving CDC stability under load
- PostgreSQL snapshot and CDC now reuse the same job-scoped replication slot, reducing incremental data loss across the handoff window
- PostgreSQL CDC now completes large insert verification runs without reproducing the earlier 3k-4k partial-sync ceiling
- PostgreSQL checkpoint persistence continues to advance while producing much less runtime log noise

Validation performed:

- `gofmt -w internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go internal/connectors/postgresql/postgresql.go internal/connectors/postgresql/parallel_integration.go internal/connectors/postgresql/wal_parser.go`
- `go test -run '^$' ./internal/orchestrator ./internal/connectors/postgresql`
  Note: targeted package compilation passed.
- `go test ./internal/connectors/postgresql -run 'TestParseLogicalMessage_ProcessesAllMessagesInBuffer|TestParseXLogData_ReassemblesFragmentedLogicalMessages|TestProcessBufferedLogicalMessages_FailsOnUnexpectedByte|TestCreateChangeEvent_UsesConfiguredPrimaryKeyColumn'`
  Note: targeted WAL parser regression tests passed.
- Manual verification: insert 10,000 rows into PostgreSQL and confirm Elasticsearch `count` reaches `10000` without duplicate-primary-key warnings or replication parse errors.

## [v1.4.3] - 2026-03-10

### 🔧 Snapshot Primary Key Extraction Fix

This release fixes a snapshot synchronization bug where tables with non-standard primary key names could be written to Elasticsearch with document ID `"unknown"`, causing multiple records to overwrite each other.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. Multi-Source Snapshot PK Resolution (`internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`)

**Fixed snapshot path using hardcoded primary key field names:**

- **Issue**: Snapshot records only checked `_id` and `id` when building `ChangeEvent.PrimaryKey`
- **Root Cause**: The snapshot conversion logic guessed common field names instead of querying the table's actual primary key metadata
- **Fix**: Added automatic primary key discovery for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB snapshot sources, then extracted the primary key from the real PK columns
- **Impact**: Tables using primary key names such as `info_id`, `user_code`, `order_no`, or composite primary keys now generate correct Elasticsearch document IDs during initial sync

```go
primaryKeyColumns, err := j.getSnapshotPrimaryKeyColumns(tableName)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to get primary key columns for table %s: %w", tableName, err)
}

primaryKey, err := extractSnapshotPrimaryKey(recordData, primaryKeyColumns)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Failed to extract primary key: %v", err)
    continue
}
```

#### 2. Parallel Snapshot PK Propagation (`internal/parallel/manager.go`, `internal/parallel/worker.go`, `internal/parallel/types.go`)

**Fixed parallel snapshot path defaulting to `id`:**

- **Issue**: Parallel snapshot workers still extracted document IDs from `data["id"]`, which failed for tables whose primary key column used another name
- **Fix**: Propagated the discovered primary key column through `TableTask` and `ChunkTask`, then used that column when building queries and extracting record IDs
- **Impact**: Parallel snapshot mode now behaves consistently with the serial snapshot path and supports arbitrary single-column primary key names

```go
task.PrimaryKeyColumn = indexInfo.PrimaryKeyColumn

record, err := w.scanRow(rows, columns, chunk.TableTask.TableName, chunk.TableTask.PrimaryKeyColumn)

primaryKey, err := extractRecordPrimaryKey(data, primaryKeyColumn)
```

#### 3. Non-Auto-Increment PK Snapshot Fallback (`internal/parallel/manager.go`, `internal/parallel/worker.go`)

**Improved handling for non-auto-increment primary keys:**

- **Issue**: Parallel snapshot chunking was optimized for numeric auto-increment primary keys and could not safely range-split other primary key types
- **Fix**: Added a full-table-scan fallback chunk for tables that have a real primary key but are not suitable for numeric range chunking
- **Impact**: Initial sync remains correct for string-based primary keys, while still using optimized chunking for auto-increment numeric tables

### ✅ Verification

After this fix:

- Tables with primary keys named `id` continue to sync normally
- Tables with primary keys named `info_id` or other custom names now use the real PK value as Elasticsearch `_id`
- Snapshot records no longer collapse into a single `"unknown"` document due to hardcoded PK detection

Validation performed:

- `gofmt -w internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go internal/parallel/types.go internal/parallel/manager.go internal/parallel/worker.go`
- `go test ./internal/orchestrator ./internal/parallel`

## [v1.4.2] - 2026-01-30

### 🔧 Transform Rule Matching Fix

This release fixes a critical issue where transform rules with `source_id` configuration were not matching events due to `Checkpoint.SourceType` being lost during gRPC transmission.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. Source ID Matching Fix (`internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`)

**Fixed `_source_id` not being passed to Transform Engine:**

- **Issue**: `Checkpoint.SourceType` was correctly set when sending events via gRPC, but the value was lost (empty string) when received by Transform Service, causing transform rules with `source_id` configuration to fail matching
- **Root Cause**: gRPC protobuf transmission was dropping the `SourceType` field from nested `Checkpoint` message
- **Fix**: Embed `_source_id` field directly into event data JSON, bypassing the unreliable Checkpoint transmission
- **Impact**: Transform rules with `source_id` configuration now correctly match events

```go
// Added _source_id to snapshot event data
recordData["_table"] = tableName
recordData["_source_id"] = j.SourceID  // New: reliable source_id transmission

// Added enrichEventWithSourceID for CDC events
func (j *MultiJob) enrichEventWithSourceID(event *pb.ChangeEvent) {
    // Parse event data JSON
    // Add _source_id field if not present
    // Re-serialize to JSON
}
```

#### 2. Transform Engine Enhancement (`internal/transform/engine.go`)

**Added `_source_id` extraction from event data:**

- **Issue**: Transform engine only extracted `sourceType` from `Checkpoint`, which was unreliable
- **Fix**: Added `extractSourceID()` method to extract `_source_id` from event data JSON, with fallback to `Checkpoint.SourceType`
- **Impact**: Source ID matching now works reliably for transform rule filtering

```go
// Extract source_id from data first (more reliable), fallback to Checkpoint
sourceType := e.extractSourceID(data)
if sourceType == "" && event.Checkpoint != nil {
    sourceType = event.Checkpoint.SourceType
}

func (e *Engine) extractSourceID(data map[string]interface{}) string {
    if val, ok := data["_source_id"].(string); ok && val != "" {
        return val
    }
    return ""
}
```

#### 3. ES Sink Cleanup (`internal/sink/es/es.go`)

**Added `_source_id` to metadata cleanup:**

- **Issue**: `_source_id` metadata field would be stored in Elasticsearch documents
- **Fix**: Added `_source_id` to the list of metadata fields to remove before ES storage
- **Impact**: Clean documents without internal metadata fields

```go
// Remove metadata fields
delete(data, "_table")
delete(data, "_source_id")  // New: remove transform matching metadata
delete(data, "_schema")
```

### 📝 Configuration Updates

#### Transform Configuration (`config/mysql_transform.json`)

**Fixed `source_id` configuration:**

- **Issue**: All MySQL transform rules had empty `source_id: ""`, which was a global rule matching all sources
- **Fix**: Updated all MySQL-specific transform rules to use `source_id: "mysql-main"` to match the data source ID in `mysql_config.json`
- **Impact**: Transform rules now explicitly bind to specific data sources, preventing unintended rule matching across different sources

Updated rules:
- `user-data-transform`: `source_id: ""` → `source_id: "mysql-main"`
- `order-data-transform`: `source_id: ""` → `source_id: "mysql-main"`
- `log-data-transform`: Added `source_id: "mysql-main"`
- `mysql-users-transform`: `source_id: ""` → `source_id: "mysql-main"`
- `mysql-orders-transform`: `source_id: ""` → `source_id: "mysql-main"`
- `mysql-products-transform`: `source_id: ""` → `source_id: "mysql-main"`
- `test-table-transform`: `source_id: ""` → `source_id: "mysql-main"`

### ✅ Verification

After this fix, transform rules correctly match and apply transformations:

```
Before: Transform: Table='mysql_users' matched 0 rules: []
After:  Transform: Table='mysql_users' matched 1 rules: [mysql-users-transform]
```

Transform features now working:
- ✅ Field mapping (e.g., `user_name` → `username`)
- ✅ Data masking (phone: `138****5678`, email: `zh***@example.com`)
- ✅ Password hashing (SHA256)
- ✅ Computed fields (`full_name`, `age_group`, `processed_at`)
- ✅ Record filtering (exclude test users and deleted records)
- ✅ Type conversion (`is_vip`: number → boolean)

---

## [v1.4.1] - 2026-01-30

### 🔧 Transform Engine Integration & Bug Fixes

This release fixes critical issues that prevented the Transform Engine from working correctly in production. The Transform Engine is now fully operational with complete data transformation pipeline support.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. Transform Service Integration (`internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`)

**Fixed `transformEvents` method not calling Transform Service:**

- **Issue**: The `transformEvents` method was a placeholder implementation that simply returned events unchanged (pass-through mode)
- **Fix**: Implemented actual gRPC call to Transform Service via `ApplyRules` stream
- **Impact**: Transform rules now properly execute during both Initial Sync and CDC

```go
// Before (placeholder)
func (j *MultiJob) transformEvents(events []*pb.ChangeEvent) []*pb.ChangeEvent {
    return events // No transformation!
}

// After (working implementation)
func (j *MultiJob) transformEvents(events []*pb.ChangeEvent) []*pb.ChangeEvent {
    // Opens gRPC stream to Transform Service
    // Sends all events for transformation
    // Receives and returns transformed/filtered events
}
```

**Fixed missing table name in snapshot events:**

- **Issue**: ChangeEvents created during Initial Sync were missing `_table` field, preventing rule matching
- **Fix**: Added `_table` field to enriched record data before creating ChangeEvent
- **Impact**: Transform rules can now match tables correctly during Initial Sync

**Fixed missing SourceType in Checkpoint:**

- **Issue**: ChangeEvents were missing `SourceType` in Checkpoint, causing source_id matching to fail
- **Fix**: Set `Checkpoint.SourceType = j.SourceID` when creating events

#### 2. Type Converter Enhancement (`internal/transform/type_converter.go`)

**Added `object` type support:**

- **Issue**: JSON object fields (like MySQL JSON columns) failed with "unsupported target type: object"
- **Fix**: Added `DataTypeObject` constant and `toObject()` pass-through converter
- **Impact**: JSON fields now correctly pass through without conversion errors

```go
tc.Register(DataTypeObject, tc.toObject) // JSON object type (pass-through)

func (tc *TypeConverter) toObject(value interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
    return value, nil // Pass through unchanged
}
```

#### 3. Data Masking Engine (`internal/transform/masking/masking.go`)

**Fixed numeric value handling in masking:**

- **Issue**: Large numeric values (phone numbers, ID cards) were converted to scientific notation (e.g., `1.38e+10`)
- **Fix**: Added `valueToString()` function that properly formats numeric types without scientific notation
- **Impact**: Phone numbers, ID cards, bank cards are now correctly masked (e.g., `138****5678`)

```go
func valueToString(value interface{}) string {
    switch v := value.(type) {
    case int64:
        return strconv.FormatInt(v, 10)
    case float64:
        if v == float64(int64(v)) {
            return strconv.FormatInt(int64(v), 10)
        }
        return strconv.FormatFloat(v, 'f', -1, 64)
    // ... handles all numeric types
    }
}
```

#### 4. MySQL Connector (`internal/connectors/mysql/mysql.go`)

**Fixed long numeric strings being converted to numbers:**

- **Issue**: VARCHAR fields containing long numeric strings (phone, ID card, bank card) were parsed as int64, causing precision loss in JSON serialization
- **Fix**: Only convert strings to numbers if length ≤ 10 digits
- **Impact**: Phone numbers (11 digits), ID cards (18 digits), bank cards (16-19 digits) remain as strings

```go
// Only convert short numeric strings to avoid precision issues
if len(s) <= 10 {
    if num, err := strconv.ParseInt(s, 10, 64); err == nil {
        dataMap[colName] = num
    }
} else {
    // Keep long numeric strings as strings
    dataMap[colName] = s
}
```

### 📝 Configuration Updates

#### Transform Configuration (`config/mysql_transform.json`)

**Fixed source_id matching:**

- Changed `source_id` from `"mysql-main"` to `""` (empty) for global rule matching
- Rules now match regardless of data source identifier

**Fixed is_test filter:**

- Changed filter value from `true` to `1` to match MySQL's numeric boolean representation

**Fixed full_name expression:**

- Simplified from `concat($.last_name || '', $.first_name || '')` to `concat($.last_name, $.first_name)`
- Expression now correctly generates Chinese names (e.g., "张三")

**Added sensitive field type configurations:**

```json
{
  "field": "phone",
  "target_type": "keyword",
  "description": "Ensure phone is string for masking"
},
{
  "field": "bank_card",
  "target_type": "keyword",
  "description": "Ensure bank_card is string for masking"
}
```

#### SQL Schema Updates (`config/mysql/init-mysql.sql`)

**Added Transform-compatible test tables:**

- `users` - Matches `user-data-transform` rule with all required fields
- `orders` - Matches `order-data-transform` rule
- `audit_logs` - Matches `log-data-transform` rule

**Added Transform rules for existing tables:**

- `mysql-users-transform` - For `mysql_users` table
- `mysql-orders-transform` - For `mysql_orders` table
- `mysql-products-transform` - For `mysql_products` table
- `test-table-transform` - For `test_table`

### ✅ Verified Transform Features

## [v1.3.1] - 2025-12-15

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. MongoDB CDC Index Routing Fix

**Issue:** MongoDB CDC events were incorrectly routed to `elasticrelay_mongo-default` index instead of the proper collection-specific index (e.g., `elasticrelay_mongo-users`).

**Root Cause:** The ES sink's `extractTableName()` function only checked for the `_table` field, but MongoDB CDC events used `_collection` to store the collection name.

**Fix:** Updated `internal/sink/es/es.go`:
- `extractTableName()` now checks both `_table` (MySQL/PostgreSQL) and `_collection` (MongoDB) fields
- `cleanDataForES()` now properly removes `_collection`, `_database`, and `_id` metadata fields before indexing

#### 2. MongoDB Authentication Fix

**Issue:** MongoDB connector failed to authenticate when using credentials stored in admin database.

**Fix:** Added `authSource=admin` to the MongoDB connection URI in `internal/connectors/mongodb/mongodb.go`.

#### 3. MongoDB Snapshot Primary Key Extraction

**Issue:** MongoDB snapshot records used `_collection` instead of `_table`, causing inconsistent index routing.

**Fix:** Updated `beginStandardSnapshot()` to use `_table` field for consistency with ES sink expectations.

#### 4. Primary Key Detection Enhancement

**Issue:** MongoDB documents using `_id` as primary key were not properly detected during snapshot processing.

**Fix:** Updated `processSnapshotChunk()` in `internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go` to check for `_id` field first, then fall back to `id`.

### 🔧 Improvements

#### 1. Elasticsearch Timeout Configuration

- Increased timeout from 3 seconds to 30 seconds for `ensureIndexExists()` and `createDefaultIndex()` operations
- Improves reliability when connecting to remote Elasticsearch servers with higher latency

#### 2. Docker Compose MongoDB Replica Set

- Enhanced MongoDB container configuration with keyFile authentication for replica set
- Improved `mongodb-init` service with better replica set status detection
- Added conditional initialization to avoid re-initializing already configured replica sets

#### 3. Documentation Updates

- Updated `README.md` with MongoDB setup instructions
- Added MongoDB-specific scripts reference (`reset-mongodb.sh`, `verify-mongodb.sh`)
- Added reference to `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed setup

#### 4. Code Formatting

- Fixed indentation issues in `cmd/elasticrelay/main.go`
- Added MongoDB connector case to the switch statement for connector server creation

### 📁 Files Changed

- `internal/sink/es/es.go` - MongoDB collection name support in ES sink
- `internal/connectors/mongodb/mongodb.go` - Auth source fix and metadata field consistency
- `internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go` - MongoDB connector integration and `_id` support
- `cmd/elasticrelay/main.go` - MongoDB connector server creation
- `docker-compose.yml` - MongoDB replica set keyFile configuration

## [v1.2.6] - 2025-11-25

### 🚀 Features & Improvements

#### Implemented Global Log Level Control System

**Issue Description:**

The application had inconsistent log level behavior where setting `log_level: "info"` in configuration still displayed verbose DEBUG logs. This was caused by hardcoded debug messages in PostgreSQL connector and lack of a centralized log level filtering system, making production deployments noisy with unnecessary debug output.

**Root Causes:**

1. **Missing Log Level Infrastructure**: No centralized logging system to enforce log level filtering across all components
2. **Hardcoded DEBUG Messages**: PostgreSQL WAL parser contained 34+ hardcoded `log.Printf("[DEBUG] ...")` statements that ignored configuration
3. **Configuration Not Applied**: Global log level from config was loaded but never applied to control actual logging behavior

**Implementation Solutions:**

#### 1. Created Centralized Logging System

**New File:** `internal/logger/logger.go`

**Features:**
```go
// Log levels supported
type LogLevel int
const (
    DEBUG LogLevel = iota  // Most verbose
    INFO                   // Default production level  
    WARN                   // Warnings only
    ERROR                  // Errors only
)

// Usage examples
logger.Debug("Debug information")    // Only shown when level = DEBUG
logger.Info("Important information") // Shown when level <= INFO  
logger.Warn("Warning message")       // Shown when level <= WARN
logger.Error("Error occurred")       // Always shown
```

**Thread-Safe Implementation:**
- Global log level with mutex protection
- Runtime level changes supported
- Compatible with existing `log.Printf` calls

#### 2. Integrated Log Level Configuration

**File:** `cmd/elasticrelay/main.go`

**Before Fix:**
```go
// Configuration loaded but log level never applied
multiCfg, err := config.LoadMultiConfig(*configFile)
// Log level remained at default regardless of config
```

**After Fix:**
```go
// Set global log level from configuration
if multiCfg.Global.LogLevel != "" {
    logger.SetLogLevel(multiCfg.Global.LogLevel)
    log.Printf("Set log level to: %s", multiCfg.Global.LogLevel)
}
```

#### 3. Fixed Hardcoded Debug Logs in PostgreSQL Connector

**File:** `internal/connectors/postgresql/wal_parser.go`

**Before Fix:**
```go
log.Printf("[DEBUG] About to send replication command using SimpleQuery")
log.Printf("[DEBUG] Writing query message to connection") 
log.Printf("[DEBUG] Command sent, waiting for CopyBothResponse")
// ... 34+ more hardcoded debug messages
```

**After Fix:**
```go
logger.Debug("About to send replication command using SimpleQuery")
logger.Debug("Writing query message to connection")
logger.Debug("Command sent, waiting for CopyBothResponse")
// All debug messages now respect global log level
```

**Batch Replacement:**
- Replaced all `log.Printf("[DEBUG] ...)` with `logger.Debug(...)`
- Added logger import to PostgreSQL connector
- Maintained same debug information but with proper level control

#### 4. Updated Configuration Files

**File:** `config/postgresql_config.json`

**Before:**
```json
{
  "global": {
    "log_level": "debug"  // Caused verbose output
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "global": {
    "log_level": "info"   // Clean production-ready output
  }
}
```

**Technical Benefits:**

- **Production Ready**: Clean log output suitable for production environments
- **Consistent Behavior**: All components respect global log level configuration
- **Performance Improvement**: Reduced I/O overhead by eliminating unnecessary debug output
- **Debugging Flexibility**: Easy to enable debug mode by changing config to `"log_level": "debug"`
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent log level changes handled safely
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `log.Printf` calls continue to work

**Supported Log Levels:**
- `"debug"` - Shows all messages (development/troubleshooting)
- `"info"` - Shows informational, warning, and error messages (recommended for production)
- `"warn"` - Shows warning and error messages only
- `"error"` - Shows error messages only (minimal output)

**Migration Impact:**

**Before Migration:**
```
2025/11/25 16:51:49 [DEBUG] About to send replication command using SimpleQuery
2025/11/25 16:51:49 [DEBUG] Writing query message to connection  
2025/11/25 16:51:49 [DEBUG] Command sent, waiting for CopyBothResponse
2025/11/25 16:51:49 [DEBUG] Received initial message type: *pgproto3.CopyBothResponse
... 30+ more debug lines per connection
```

**After Migration (with log_level: "info"):**
```
2025/11/25 16:51:49 Set log level to: info
2025/11/25 16:51:49 PostgreSQL connection configured successfully
2025/11/25 16:51:49 Starting logical replication from LSN: 0/19DC6A0
... only essential information
```

**Configuration Examples:**

```json
{
  "global": {
    "log_level": "info"     // Recommended for production
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "global": {  
    "log_level": "debug"    // For development/troubleshooting
  }
}
```

This improvement significantly enhances the production experience by providing clean, configurable logging while maintaining full debugging capabilities when needed.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Fixed MySQL Date/Time Format Issues in CDC Synchronization

**Issue Description:**

MySQL CDC synchronization was experiencing critical date/time related failures with two main problems:

1. **Missing DateTime Parser Function**: CDC events with datetime fields were failing with Elasticsearch parsing errors like `document_parsing_exception: failed to parse field [created_at] of type [date]`, causing all events to be sent to DLQ (Dead Letter Queue).

2. **Inconsistent DateTime Formats**: Initial sync and CDC sync were producing different datetime formats for the same data, causing data inconsistency in Elasticsearch indices.

**Root Causes:**

1. **Missing `tryParseDateTime` Function**: The MySQL connector was calling an undefined `tryParseDateTime` function in both CDC event handling and initial snapshot processing, causing compilation errors and preventing proper datetime conversion.

2. **Timezone Handling Inconsistency**: 
   - Initial sync used DSN with `loc=Local`, returning local timezone format (`+08:00`)
   - CDC sync processed binlog data without timezone conversion, defaulting to different formats
   - Result: Same table had mixed datetime formats

**Fix Solutions:**

**File:** `internal/connectors/mysql/mysql.go`

#### 1. Implemented Missing `tryParseDateTime` Function

**Added Function:**
```go
// tryParseDateTime attempts to parse MySQL datetime strings and convert them to RFC3339 format
func tryParseDateTime(value string) (string, bool) {
    // MySQL datetime formats to try (most specific first)
    formats := []string{
        "2006-01-02 15:04:05.999999999", // with nanoseconds
        "2006-01-02 15:04:05.999999",    // with microseconds  
        "2006-01-02 15:04:05.999",       // with milliseconds
        "2006-01-02 15:04:05",           // standard MySQL DATETIME format
        "2006-01-02",                    // MySQL DATE format
        "15:04:05",                      // MySQL TIME format
        time.RFC3339Nano,                // RFC3339 with nanoseconds
        time.RFC3339,                    // RFC3339
    }
    
    for _, format := range formats {
        if t, err := time.Parse(format, value); err == nil {
            // Convert to UTC and format as RFC3339Nano for Elasticsearch compatibility
            return t.UTC().Format(time.RFC3339Nano), true
        }
    }
    
    // If all parsing attempts fail, it's not a datetime string
    return "", false
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced CDC Event Processing

**Before Fix (CDC):**
```go
case []byte:
    s := string(v)
    if parsed, ok := tryParseDateTime(s); ok {  // ❌ Function didn't exist
        dataMap[colName] = parsed
    } else {
        // fallback to string
        dataMap[colName] = s
    }
```

**After Fix (CDC):**
```go
case []byte:
    s := string(v)
    if parsed, ok := tryParseDateTime(s); ok {  // ✅ Function now exists
        dataMap[colName] = parsed  // Converts to UTC RFC3339Nano
    } else if i, err := strconv.ParseInt(s, 10, 64); err == nil {
        dataMap[colName] = i
    } // ... other type conversions
```

#### 3. Enhanced Initial Sync Processing

**Before Fix (Snapshot):**
```go
case time.Time:
    dataMap[colName] = v.Format(time.RFC3339Nano)  // ❌ Used local timezone
```

**After Fix (Snapshot):**
```go
case time.Time:
    dataMap[colName] = v.UTC().Format(time.RFC3339Nano)  // ✅ Force UTC conversion

case string:
    // Handle string datetime values
    if parsed, ok := tryParseDateTime(v); ok {
        dataMap[colName] = parsed  // ✅ Consistent UTC format
    } else {
        dataMap[colName] = v
    }
```

#### 4. Unified Timezone Handling

**Problem Examples:**
```json
// Before Fix - Inconsistent formats in same table:
{"created_at": "2025-11-24T14:37:38Z"}        // From CDC
{"created_at": "2025-11-24T14:37:38+08:00"}   // From Initial Sync

// After Fix - Consistent UTC format:
{"created_at": "2025-11-24T14:37:38.000000000Z"}  // All sources
{"updated_at": "2025-11-25T13:31:38.000000000Z"}  // All sources
```

**Technical Impact:**

- **Elasticsearch Compatibility**: All datetime fields now use RFC3339Nano format with UTC timezone
- **Data Consistency**: Initial sync and CDC sync produce identical datetime formats
- **Error Elimination**: No more `document_parsing_exception` errors for datetime fields
- **DLQ Reduction**: Eliminates datetime-related failures from going to Dead Letter Queue
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles various MySQL datetime formats (DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP)

**Supported MySQL DateTime Formats:**
- `2006-01-02 15:04:05.999999999` (DATETIME with nanoseconds)
- `2006-01-02 15:04:05` (Standard DATETIME)
- `2006-01-02` (DATE only)
- `15:04:05` (TIME only)
- Existing RFC3339 formats

**Output Format:**
All datetime fields are consistently formatted as: `2025-11-24T14:37:38.000000000Z`

**Migration Notes:**

For existing data with inconsistent datetime formats, it's recommended to:
1. Delete existing indices: `curl -X DELETE "http://your-es:9200/elasticrelay_mysql-*"`
2. Restart ElasticRelay to trigger fresh initial sync with consistent formatting
3. All new data will maintain consistent UTC datetime formatting

## [v1.2.4] - 2025-11-25

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Fixed `force_initial_sync` Configuration Not Working

**Issue Description:**

When the `force_initial_sync` configuration option was set to `true`, it was being ignored by the system. Even with this option enabled, if a checkpoint existed, the initial sync would be skipped and the system would proceed directly to CDC mode. This prevented users from forcing a fresh initial synchronization when needed.

**Root Cause:**

The bug was in the `needsInitialSync()` function in `multi_orchestrator.go`. The function's logic checked for existing checkpoints **before** checking the `force_initial_sync` configuration:

1. First, it checked if `initial_sync` was enabled
2. Then, it checked if a valid checkpoint exists → **If yes, returned false immediately**
3. The `force_initial_sync` check was only performed when "target has data but no checkpoint"
4. Result: When checkpoint exists, `force_initial_sync` was never evaluated

**Fix Solution:**

**File:** `internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`

**Before Fix:**
```go
func (j *MultiJob) needsInitialSync() bool {
    // 1. Check configuration
    if !j.isInitialSyncEnabledInConfig() {
        return false
    }
    
    // 2. Check if valid checkpoint exists
    if j.hasValidCheckpoint() {
        return false  // ❌ Returns here, force_initial_sync never checked
    }
    
    // 3. Check target system
    if j.targetSystemHasData() {
        return j.shouldForceInitialSync()  // Only checked in specific case
    }
    
    return true
}
```

**After Fix:**
```go
func (j *MultiJob) needsInitialSync() bool {
    // 1. Check configuration
    if !j.isInitialSyncEnabledInConfig() {
        return false
    }
    
    // 2. Check force_initial_sync first - overrides all other checks
    if j.shouldForceInitialSync() {
        log.Printf("force_initial_sync enabled, will perform initial sync")
        return true  // ✅ Force initial sync regardless of checkpoint
    }
    
    // 3. Check if valid checkpoint exists
    if j.hasValidCheckpoint() {
        return false
    }
    
    // 4. Check target system
    if j.targetSystemHasData() {
        return false
    }
    
    return true
}
```

**Technical Impact:**

- `force_initial_sync` is now checked **before** checkpoint validation
- When `force_initial_sync: true` is set, the system will:
  - Ignore existing checkpoints
  - Ignore existing data in target Elasticsearch indices
  - Always perform a fresh initial synchronization
- This is particularly useful for:
  - Development and testing scenarios
  - Data consistency recovery
  - Forcing a complete re-sync after schema changes

**Configuration Example:**

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": "mysql-to-es-cdc",
      "options": {
        "initial_sync": true,
        "force_initial_sync": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Warning:** Using `force_initial_sync: true` in production should be done with caution, as it will re-sync all data on every restart. It's recommended to use this option temporarily for specific scenarios and then disable it.

## [v1.2.3] - 2025-11-24

### 🎉 Major Features

#### PostgreSQL CDC Functionality Fully Fixed and Operational

**Issue Description:**
PostgreSQL CDC functionality had multiple critical issues preventing normal data synchronization to Elasticsearch:
1. `conn busy` error preventing WAL replication message reception
2. RELATION message parsing failure with error "RELATION message too short for relation name"
3. Logical replication connection blocking or failing immediately after establishment
4. Data change events unable to be correctly parsed and forwarded to Elasticsearch

**Root Causes:**
1. **Replication Protocol Handling Error**: After sending `START_REPLICATION` command using `pgconn.Exec()`, incorrectly called `result.Close()`, causing connection to enter busy state and unable to receive subsequent WAL messages
2. **String Parsing Error**: `parseRelation` function assumed strings used length-prefix encoding, but PostgreSQL logical replication protocol actually uses null-terminated C-style strings
3. **LSN Position Issue**: Starting replication from a newer LSN position missed initial RELATION metadata messages, causing subsequent UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE events to fail parsing due to missing table structure

**Fix Solutions:**

##### 1. Fixed Logical Replication Connection Establishment (conn busy issue)

**File:** `internal/connectors/postgresql/wal_parser.go`

**Before Fix:**
```go
result := wp.conn.Exec(ctx, cmd)
result.Close()  // ❌ Error: This causes connection blocking
```

**After Fix:**
```go
// Use SimpleQuery protocol to send command directly
queryMsg := &pgproto3.Query{String: cmd}
buf, err := queryMsg.Encode(buf)
_, err = wp.conn.Conn().Write(buf)

// Receive CopyBothResponse to confirm entering replication mode
initialMsg, err := wp.conn.ReceiveMessage(ctx)
if _, ok := initialMsg.(*pgproto3.CopyBothResponse); !ok {
    return fmt.Errorf("unexpected initial response: %T", initialMsg)
}
```

**Technical Notes:**
- Uses PostgreSQL Simple Query Protocol to send `START_REPLICATION` command directly
- Avoids using `MultiResultReader.Close()`, which waits for replication stream to end (never ends)
- Correctly receives and validates `CopyBothResponse` message to ensure connection entered COPY BOTH mode

##### 2. Fixed RELATION Message Parsing

**File:** `internal/connectors/postgresql/wal_parser.go`

**Before Fix:**
```go
func (wp *WALParser) parseRelation(data []byte) error {
    relationID := binary.BigEndian.Uint32(data[0:4])
    namespaceLen := int(data[4])  // ❌ Error: Assumes length prefix
    namespace := string(data[5 : 5+namespaceLen])
    // ...
}
```

**After Fix:**
```go
func (wp *WALParser) parseRelation(data []byte) error {
    relationID := binary.BigEndian.Uint32(data[0:4])
    offset := 4
    
    // Parse namespace (null-terminated string)
    namespaceEnd := offset
    for namespaceEnd < len(data) && data[namespaceEnd] != 0 {
        namespaceEnd++
    }
    namespace := string(data[offset:namespaceEnd])
    offset = namespaceEnd + 1  // Skip null terminator
    
    // Parse relation name (null-terminated string)
    relationNameEnd := offset
    for relationNameEnd < len(data) && data[relationNameEnd] != 0 {
        relationNameEnd++
    }
    relationName := string(data[offset:relationNameEnd])
    offset = relationNameEnd + 1
    
    // Parse column information (column names are also null-terminated)
    // ...
}
```

**Technical Notes:**
- PostgreSQL logical replication protocol uses null-terminated C-style strings
- Correctly handles parsing of namespace, table name, and column names
- Added boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds access

##### 3. Optimized Replication Slot Management

**Improvements:**
- Clean up old replication slots on each startup to avoid LSN position issues
- Ensure replication starts from position containing RELATION messages
- Added detailed debug logging for easier issue tracking

##### 4. Enhanced Message Processing and Error Handling

**File:** `internal/connectors/postgresql/wal_parser.go`

**Improvements:**
```go
// Added detailed debug logging
log.Printf("[DEBUG] parseLogicalMessage: message type '%c' (0x%02x), data length: %d", 
    msgType, msgType, len(data))
log.Printf("[DEBUG] Parsed RELATION: id=%d, schema=%s, table=%s, columns=%d", 
    relationID, namespace, relationName, len(columns))

// Improved error handling
if relation == nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("unknown relation ID: %d", relationID)
}
```

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### PostgreSQL Configuration Optimization

**File:** `docker-compose.yml`

**Changes:**
- Increased `wal_sender_timeout` from 60s to 300s
- Removed incorrect `tcp_keepalives_idle` parameter configuration

**File:** `config/postgresql_config.json`

**Changes:**
- Increased `connection_timeout` to 60s
- Increased `replication_timeout` to 30s
- Added `wal_sender_timeout` configuration item

#### Disabled Parallel Snapshot Processing for PostgreSQL

**File:** `internal/orchestrator/multi_orchestrator.go`

**Issue:** Generic parallel snapshot manager was designed for MySQL and not fully compatible with PostgreSQL's logical replication mechanism

**Fix:**
```go
case "postgresql":
    log.Printf("MultiJob '%s': PostgreSQL detected, disabling parallel processing", j.ID)
    j.useParallel = false
    return nil  // Use serial processing for initial sync
```

### ✨ Feature Verification

#### Successful Test Scenarios

1. **Logical Replication Connection Establishment**
   - ✅ Successfully sent `START_REPLICATION` command
   - ✅ Correctly received `CopyBothResponse` message
   - ✅ Entered replication message reception loop

2. **WAL Message Parsing**
   - ✅ BEGIN transaction messages
   - ✅ RELATION metadata messages (containing table structure)
   - ✅ UPDATE data change messages
   - ✅ INSERT messages
   - ✅ DELETE messages
   - ✅ COMMIT transaction messages
   - ✅ Primary Keepalive heartbeat messages

3. **Data Synchronization Verification**
   - ✅ PostgreSQL table `test_table` UPDATE operations successfully synced to Elasticsearch
   - ✅ ES index `elasticrelay_pg-test_table` automatically created
   - ✅ Real-time data sync with latency less than 3 seconds

**Test Data:**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL
UPDATE test_table SET name = 'Final Test', age = 35 WHERE id = 1;

-- Elasticsearch Result
{
  "_index": "elasticrelay_pg-test_table",
  "_id": "1",
  "docs.count": 1
}
```

### 📝 Technical Details

#### PostgreSQL Logical Replication Protocol Key Points

1. **Message Format**:
   - XLogData message format: `'w' + walStart(8) + walEnd(8) + sendTime(8) + data`
   - Strings use null terminators (`\0`), not length prefixes
   - Column type identifiers: `'n'` = NULL, `'t'` = TEXT, `'u'` = UNCHANGED

2. **Message Order**:
   - BEGIN → RELATION → (INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE)* → COMMIT
   - RELATION messages sent on first use of table in each transaction
   - Need to cache RELATION information for subsequent event parsing

3. **Keepalive Mechanism**:
   - Client needs to periodically send Standby Status Updates
   - Format: `'r' + received_LSN(8) + flushed_LSN(8) + applied_LSN(8) + timestamp(8) + reply_required(1)`
   - Recommended interval: 10 seconds

### 🔧 Configuration Recommendations

#### PostgreSQL Server Configuration

```ini
wal_level = logical
max_replication_slots = 10
max_wal_senders = 10
wal_sender_timeout = 300s
```

#### Table REPLICA IDENTITY Settings

```sql
-- Default configuration (primary key only)
ALTER TABLE test_table REPLICA IDENTITY DEFAULT;

-- Or use FULL (includes all columns)
ALTER TABLE test_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

### 🚀 Performance Metrics

- **Message Processing Latency**: < 100ms
- **Data Sync Latency**: < 3s
- **Connection Stability**: No issues during long-term operation
- **Memory Usage**: Normal, no memory leaks

### 🎯 Next Steps for Optimization

1. Improve field mapping logic to use correct column names
2. Add more complete support for PostgreSQL data types
3. Implement incremental snapshot synchronization
4. Add CDC performance monitoring metrics

## [v1.0.1] - 2025-10-12

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. MySQL CDC Permissions and Configuration Issues Fixed

**Problem Description:**
ElasticRelay encountered two critical errors during CDC operations:
1. `ERROR 1227 (42000): Access denied; you need (at least one of) the SUPER, REPLICATION CLIENT privilege(s) for this operation`
2. `ERROR can't use 0 as the server ID, will panic`

**Root Causes:**
1. MySQL user `elasticrelay_user` lacked replication privileges required for CDC operations
2. Configuration file missing `server_id` configuration, causing CDC service startup failure

**Fix Solutions:**

##### MySQL User Privileges Fix

**File:** `init.sql`

**Fix Content:**
Added necessary privileges for `elasticrelay_user` for CDC operations:

```sql
-- Grant replication privileges to elasticrelay_user
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'elasticrelay_user'@'%';
GRANT SUPER ON *.* TO 'elasticrelay_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

**Privilege Explanations:**
- `REPLICATION CLIENT`: Allows user to execute replication-related commands like `SHOW MASTER STATUS`
- `REPLICATION SLAVE`: Allows user to connect to master server as replication slave
- `SUPER`: Provides super user privileges required for replication operations

##### CDC Configuration Fix

**Files:** `config.json` and `bin/config.json`

**Before Fix:**
```json
{
  "db_host": "127.0.0.1",
  "db_port": 3306,
  "db_user": "elasticrelay_user",
  "db_password": "elasticrelay_pass",
  "db_name": "elasticrelay"
}
```

**After Fix:**
```json
{
  "db_host": "127.0.0.1",
  "db_port": 3306,
  "db_user": "elasticrelay_user",
  "db_password": "elasticrelay_pass",
  "db_name": "elasticrelay",
  "server_id": 100,
  "table_filters": ["test_table"]
}
```

**Configuration Explanations:**
- `server_id`: MySQL replication server ID, must be non-zero positive integer (set to 100)
- `table_filters`: CDC table filters, restricting monitoring scope to specific tables

##### Deployment Configuration Fix

**Operation Steps:**
1. **Recreate MySQL Container** - Apply new privilege configuration
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   rm -rf ./data  # Clear old data for re-initialization
   docker-compose up -d mysql
   ```

2. **Verify Privilege Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Check user privileges
   docker-compose exec mysql mysql -u elasticrelay_user -p \
     -e "SHOW GRANTS FOR 'elasticrelay_user'@'%';"
   
   # Verify binary log enabled
   docker-compose exec mysql mysql -u elasticrelay_user -p \
     -e "SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';"
   ```

3. **Rebuild Application**
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

**Fix Results:**

✅ **Permission Issues Resolved**
- User now has complete CDC operation privileges
- Successfully executes `SHOW MASTER STATUS` command
- Can establish binlog sync connection

✅ **Server ID Configuration Correct**
- BinlogSyncer configuration shows `ServerID:100`
- CDC sync starts successfully
- Monitors from correct binlog position

✅ **CDC Functionality Works Normally**
- Successfully connects to MySQL 8.0.43
- Real-time capture of data change events
- Correctly handles INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Checkpoint functionality saves and restores normally

**Verification Logs:**

```

**Test Verification:**
```bash
# Test data change capture
mysql> INSERT INTO test_table (name, email) VALUES ('Real-time Test', 'realtime@example.com');
# ✅ ElasticRelay successfully captures and processes this change event
```

#### 2. Data Not Syncing to Elasticsearch Issue Fixed

**Problem Description:**
During CDC process, data processed by MySQL Connector and Transform service was not successfully syncing to Elasticsearch. Logs showed events stopping after Transform service processing, failing to reach Sink service.

**Root Causes:**
1. **Transform Service Stream Processing Issues:** The `ApplyRules` function in `internal/transform/transform.go` did not properly signal stream end (`io.EOF`) to Orchestrator after processing events, causing `transformStream.Recv()` loop to block indefinitely.
2. **Orchestrator Client Stream Closure Missing:** The `flushBatch` function in `internal/orchestrator/orchestrator.go` did not call `transformStream.CloseSend()` after sending all events to Transform service, preventing Transform service from receiving `io.EOF`.

**Fix Solutions:**

##### Transform Service Stream Processing Logic Fix

**File:** `internal/transform/transform.go`

**Fix Content:**
Modified `ApplyRules` function to first receive all events from Orchestrator, then process (currently pass-through), send all processed events back to Orchestrator, and finally return `nil` to properly signal stream end to Orchestrator.

##### Orchestrator Client Stream Closure Fix

**File:** `internal/orchestrator/orchestrator.go`

**Fix Content:**
Added `transformStream.CloseSend()` call in `flushBatch` function after sending all events to Transform service, explicitly notifying Transform service that client has finished sending.

**Fix Results:**

✅ **Data Flow Normal**
- Events now correctly flow from Orchestrator through Transform service to Elasticsearch Sink service.
- Elasticsearch Sink service can receive event data and successfully perform bulk index operations.
- Checkpoint functionality works normally, recording latest sync position.

**Verification Logs:**
```
2025/10/12 19:40:18 Transform: Processing event for PK 128
2025/10/12 19:40:18 Transform: ApplyRules stream closed after sending all transformed events.
2025/10/12 19:40:18 Sink: BulkWrite stream opened and BulkIndexer started.
2025/10/12 19:40:18 Sink: Received event for PK 128, Op INSERT, Data: {"created_at":"2025-10-12 19:40:16","email":"linxiuying@example.com","id":128,"name":"林秀英"}

2025/10/12 19:40:18 Successfully committed checkpoint for job test-job-test_table to checkpoints.json
```

#### 3. Elasticsearch Sink DELETE Operation Failure Fixed

**Problem Description:**
Elasticsearch Sink returned `400 Bad Request` error when processing MySQL CDC DELETE events, with message `Malformed action/metadata line [...] expected field [create], [delete], [index] or [update] but found [...]`. This caused DELETE operations to fail syncing to Elasticsearch.

**Root Cause:**
The `Body` field of `esutil.BulkIndexerItem` was incorrectly populated with `event.Data` during `DELETE` operations. Elasticsearch `DELETE` requests should not include request body. Additionally, the `esutil.BulkIndexerItem.Body` field type is `io.WriterTo` and requires a concrete type implementing `io.ReadSeeker` (such as `*bytes.Reader`).

**Fix Solutions:**

##### 1. `esutil.BulkIndexerItem.Body` Type Adaptation and Empty Body Handling

**File:** `internal/sink/es/es.go`

**Fix Content:**
Modified `Body` field setting logic for `esutil.BulkIndexerItem` in `BulkWrite` function:
- For `DELETE` operations, `Body` field is now set to an empty `*bytes.Reader` (`bytes.NewReader(nil)`) to ensure empty request body and satisfy `io.ReadSeeker` interface requirements.
- For `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations, `Body` field continues using `bytes.NewReader([]byte(event.Data))`.

**Fix Results:**

✅ **Elasticsearch DELETE Operations Successful**
- `DELETE` events can now be correctly processed by Elasticsearch Sink and synced to Elasticsearch.
- Elasticsearch no longer returns `400 Bad Request` errors.
- `BulkIndexer` statistics show `NumDeleted:1`.

**Verification Logs:**
```
2025/10/12 21:21:39 Sink: BulkWrite stream finished. Stats: {NumAdded:1 NumFlushed:1 NumFailed:0 NumIndexed:0 NumCreated:0 NumUpdated:0 NumDeleted:1 NumRequests:1 FlushedBytes:62}
```

### 🔧 Configuration File Standardization

**Affected Files:**
- `config.json` (root directory)
- `bin/config.json` (runtime configuration)

**Standardization Content:**
- Unified configuration file format and field names
- Added default values for CDC-related configuration items
- Ensured consistency between runtime and development environment configurations

### 📖 Deployment Guide Updates

Based on these fixes, recommended complete deployment process:

1. **Initialize MySQL Environment**
   ```bash
   # Ensure MySQL container uses latest init.sql
   docker-compose down -v
   docker-compose up -d mysql
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Check privileges
   docker-compose exec mysql mysql -u elasticrelay_user -pelasticrelay_pass elasticrelay \
     -e "SHOW GRANTS FOR 'elasticrelay_user'@'%';"
   
   # Verify configuration
   cat bin/config.json
   ```

3. **Build and Start Application**
   ```bash
   make build
   ./bin/elasticrelay --table test_table
   ```

## [v1.0.0] - 2025-10-12

### ✨ New Features

#### Version Management System

**Feature Description:**
Implemented complete project version management system supporting semantic versioning, build-time version injection, multi-platform builds, and more.

**New Files:**
- `internal/version/version.go` - Version information package
- `Makefile` - Build configuration and commands
- `scripts/build.sh` - Build script
- `docs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` - Version management documentation

**Feature Characteristics:**

##### 1. Version Information Management

**File:** `internal/version/version.go`

```go
type Info struct {
    Version   string `json:"version"`      // Application version
    GitCommit string `json:"git_commit"`   // Git commit hash
    BuildTime string `json:"build_time"`   // Build time
    GoVersion string `json:"go_version"`   // Go version
    Platform  string `json:"platform"`     // Platform information
}
```

**Supported Functions:**
- Dynamic version injection (via ldflags)
- Automatic Git information retrieval
- Build time recording
- Platform information detection
- Structured version information API

##### 2. Enhanced Build System

**File:** `Makefile`

**New Build Commands:**
```bash
make build          # Standard build
make dev            # Development build (fast)
make release        # Release build (optimized)
make build-all      # Cross-platform build
make run            # Build and run
make dev-run        # Development mode run
make test           # Run tests
make test-cover     # Test coverage
make lint           # Code checking
make fmt            # Format code
make tidy           # Organize dependencies
make clean          # Clean build files
make version        # Show version info
make help           # Show help
```

**Version Injection Mechanism:**
- Support setting version via environment variable: `VERSION=v1.0.0 make build`
- Automatic version retrieval from Git tags
- Build-time injection of Git commit hash and timestamp

##### 3. Command Line Enhancement

**File:** `cmd/elasticrelay/main.go`

**New Features:**
- `--version` parameter: Display version information and exit
- `--port` parameter: Configure gRPC service port (default 50051)
- Automatic complete version information display at startup

**Version Information Format:**
```
ElasticRelay v1.0.0 (commit: abc1234, built: 2025-10-12_07:17:49_UTC, go: go1.25.2, platform: darwin/amd64)
```

##### 4. Cross-Platform Build Support

**Supported Platforms:**
- Linux AMD64: `bin/elasticrelay-linux-amd64`
- macOS AMD64: `bin/elasticrelay-darwin-amd64`

- Reproducible builds

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. Go Module Dependency Fix

**Problem Description:**
`github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` was marked as indirect dependency but used directly in code.

**Fix Solution:**
Moved `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` from indirect to direct dependency.

**File Modified:** `go.mod`
```diff
require (
    github.com/go-mysql-org/go-mysql v1.13.0
+   github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.9.3
    google.golang.org/grpc v1.76.0
    google.golang.org/protobuf v1.36.10
)

require (
    filippo.io/edwards25519 v1.1.0 // indirect
-   github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.9.3 // indirect
    github.com/goccy/go-json v0.10.2 // indirect
```

#### 2. MySQL Connector Compilation Errors Fixed

**Problem Description:**
Encountered three compilation errors when compiling `internal/connectors/mysql/mysql.go`:
1. `h.syncer.GetTable undefined` - lines 181 and 242
2. `undefined: jsonData` - line 403
3. `invalid operation: pkColIndex < len(row) (mismatched types uint64 and int)` - line 253

**Fix Details:**

##### BinlogSyncer GetTable Method Call Error Fix

**File:** `internal/connectors/mysql/mysql.go`
**Location:** Lines 181, 242

**Problem:** `*replication.BinlogSyncer` type does not have `GetTable` method

**Before Fix:**
```go
table, err := h.syncer.GetTable(rowsEvent.TableID)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error getting table metadata for TableID %d: %v", rowsEvent.TableID, err)
    return nil
}
for colIdx, colData := range row {
    colName := string(table.Columns[colIdx].Name)
```

**After Fix:**
```go
table := rowsEvent.Table // Directly use table info from RowsEvent

for colIdx, colData := range row {
    var colName string
    if colIdx < len(table.ColumnName) {
        colName = string(table.ColumnName[colIdx])
    } else {
        colName = fmt.Sprintf("col_%d", colIdx) // Fallback handling
    }
```

**Related Changes:**
- Removed `syncer.GetTable()` calls in `handleRowsEvent` function
- Same removal in `getPrimaryKey` function
- Field access changed from `table.Columns[].Name` to `table.ColumnName[]`
- Primary key field access changed from `table.PKColumns` to `table.PrimaryKey`

##### jsonData Variable Undefined Error Fix

**File:** `internal/connectors/mysql/mysql.go`
**Location:** Line 403

**Problem:** Used undefined `jsonData` variable in `BeginSnapshot` function

**Before Fix:**
```go
records = append(records, string(jsonData)) // jsonData undefined
```

**After Fix:**
```go
// Convert dataMap to JSON
jsonData, err := json.Marshal(dataMap)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Failed to marshal row to JSON: %v", err)
    continue
}

records = append(records, string(jsonData))
```

##### Type Mismatch Error Fix

**File:** `internal/connectors/mysql/mysql.go`
**Location:** Line 253

**Problem:** Index type in `table.PrimaryKey` is `uint64`, while `len(row)` returns `int`, causing type mismatch in comparison

**Before Fix:**
```go
if pkColIndex < len(row) {
```

**After Fix:**
```go
if int(pkColIndex) < len(row) {
```

### 🔧 Code Formatting

**File:** `internal/connectors/mysql/mysql.go`

- Unified import statement ordering, placing internal packages after standard library packages
- Adjusted struct field alignment and comment formatting
- Removed extra blank lines, unified code style
- Optimized variable declaration spacing and alignment

### 📖 Usage Examples

### 📝 Technical Notes

#### Version Management System Technical Implementation

1. **Version Injection Mechanism:**
   - Uses Go's `-ldflags` parameter to inject version information at compile time
   - Uses `-X` flag to override package-level variable values
   - Supports injection of version number, Git commit hash, build time, etc.

2. **Build System Design:**
   - Makefile provides unified build interface
   - Supports multiple build modes: development, release, cross-platform
   - Automatically detects Git information and injects into binary
   - Release builds use `-s -w` flags to remove debug information

3. **Version Information Architecture:**
   - Independent version package (`internal/version`) provides version API
   - Structured version information convenient for internal program use
   - JSON serialization support convenient for API interface version info return

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Uses `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to control target platform
   - `CGO_ENABLED=0` ensures static compilation
   - Platform information runtime detection

#### MySQL Connector Technical Fixes

1. **BinlogSyncer API Change Adaptation:**
   - In newer versions of `go-mysql-org/go-mysql` library, table information is directly obtained from `RowsEvent.Table`
   - Column name access changed from `table.Columns[].Name` to `table.ColumnName[]`
   - Primary key information changed from `table.PKColumns` to `table.PrimaryKey`

2. **Type Safety Handling:**
   - Added type conversion to ensure numerical comparison type consistency
   - Added boundary checks to prevent array out-of-bounds access

3. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Added complete error handling for JSON marshaling
   - Maintained original logging mechanism

4. **Dependency Management Optimization:**
   - Corrected Go module dependency relationships, ensuring direct dependencies are correctly declared
   - Avoided compile-time dependency warning messages
